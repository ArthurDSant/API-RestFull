# API RestFull with FastAPI
![FastAPI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da41566c-1e55-4375-8bd9-cba9595568fc)
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a standardized architectural style for designing networked applications. It utilizes HTTP requests to manage resources through a set of predefined operations: GET for retrieving data, POST for creating new resources, PUT for updating existing ones, and DELETE for removing resources. REST principles emphasize stateless communication, where each request from a client contains all necessary information, and resource identification via URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). This approach promotes scalability, flexibility, and the separation of client and server concerns, making it suitable for web services and microservices architecture.
